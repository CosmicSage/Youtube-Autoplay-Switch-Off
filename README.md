# Goal
If You are like me, then you generally surf the internet in 'private' mode without signing into google etc.....

Youtube Autoplay annoys me to the core and disrupts my awareness state when I visit Youtube by playing the crap in the recommendation field without my permission ðŸ˜¡

Thus I made this extension which puts the bastard to the sword

## How It Works
1. So essentially when you open any video on Youtube the extension will disable Autoplay.
2. Now its your choice. If you enable it then extension shall not interfere


## Installation
Though I haven't uploaded this to the web-store, because It costs $5, Installation is very simple:

1. Download this file and extract it
2. Type chrome://extension on Chrome's search bar and hit enter
3. Enable Developer Mode in top right corner
4. Click on 'Load Unpacked'
5. Select This Folder
6. Click on details button on the extension and enable in "incognito"

You can now disable Developer Mode

## Future
Eventually Upload to the store & fix the popup
You'll probably need to reload the "video" page for it to work
